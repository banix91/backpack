        <h2>Following the command of Jesus…“Go and do likewise.”</h2>
        <h3>In 2019, there were over 700 shootings in Baltimore City.</h3>
        <p>The opportunity to minster to victims of gun violence is great.
          It also provides the faith community a great opportunity to do whatever
          they can to show the love of Christ to victims of gun violence.
          We all can play a part helping those in need.</p>

            <h3>Demonstrating the heart of Christ</h3>
            <p>The story of the Good Samaritan found in Luke 10:30-37 shows all of us the
               heart of Christ when it comes to serving those that are victims of crime.
               Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.” What an amazing command from Jesus.
               When we stand with and encourage victims of gun violence, we clearly demonstrate
               the heart of Christ by showing mercy to those that have been wounded physically
               and emotionally.</p>
